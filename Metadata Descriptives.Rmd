```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#Publisher

```{r}
length(unique(metadata$publisher))
```

There are 883 unique Publishers, so it's not just Grinnell College!

#Resource

```{r}
length(unique(metadata$resource))
```

There are 36 kinds of resource types represented in the collections.

```{r}
length(unique(metadata$resource))
summary(metadata$resource)
```

We will need to do some cleaning of this variable for it to be usable. 

#Geo

```{r}
length(unique(metadata$geo))
summary(metadata$geo)
```

An overwhelmning number of these are from Grinnell, IA. 
A great deal of them are NA's. This variable isn't yet ready for use in analysis. 

#Date

```{r}
summary(metadata$date)
```

We can use this to make the date into a categorical variable for wordclouds, etc.
