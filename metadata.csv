The experiment utilizes a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and visually demonstrates the loss of interference fringes when a which-way measurement is imposed, and the restoration of that pattern when the which-way information is destroyed. This device is also sensitive enough to observe interference fringes arising from single photons. At a level accessible to undergraduates, we present simple analyses of the interference appropriate for the coherent classical field limit, and the single photon limit.

"403","Am I Not a Man and a Brother?","grinnell:25494","In this block, the artist has chosen to highlight a commonly used symbol of the abolitionist movement; a slave kneeling with chained wrists held up, begging for his freedom. Created by members of the Clapham Sect of the Church of England in 1787, the image was so popularly consumed, historians have referred to it as a “pièce de resistance” of the campaign. However, the image is controversial to some because of the subordinate and sanitized representation it gives of slavery. Rather than portraying a reality of enslavement, torture, oppression, and resistance, the image appealed to the abolitionist ideals of morality, virtue, and truth. With this block, the artists urges their audience to grapple with the impact that historically sanitized images of slavery can cause, especially on younger generations. By portraying the slave as begging his oppressors for his freedom and humility, the image has replicated the very hierarchy it is trying to combat. Nonetheless, the image is contextualized with historical importance from the role it played in the abolitionist movement. By re-assessing images of abolition and rebellion, the artist urges people to contemplate popular controversies about the glorification of confederate monuments and the legacy of slavery in shaping American national identity.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","America, Abolition, Abolitionist History, Anti-Slavery, Slavery, Chains, Church of England","Still Image",NA,"United States"

This image is one of many prints and paintings that were circulated in Europe in the 18th century depicting the colonization of the island of Hispaniola, one of many Caribbean islands whose people were enslaved by French and British colonizers for the mass production of sugarcane and molasses. As we peer into this scene, we are put into the shoes of the Europeans who confronted slavery and racism from thousands of miles away. Some endorsed this violent exploitation and commended the officers deemed brave enough to consort with savages, while others silently disapproved, and even fewer spoke out in opposition. Today, as we confront issues of privilege and race in different and more nuanced ways, we must stop and think: are we content to quietly oppose, or is it our duty to speak out against racism and violence?

The artist has placed drawings of an active foot and hand, body parts most commonly immobilized by chains and ropes during slavery, at the center of this piece, and surrounded them with leaves, flowers, keys, broken chains, drops of blood, and long-lost pieces of jewelry, items evocative of a past left behind and destroyed at the hands of slavery. These items appear to rotate in a circle around the foot and hand caught in the moments before taking a step or lifting the page of a book, giving the piece an element of movement and the feeling of ceaseless change. This piece encourages the viewer to remember the terribleness of physical bondage and enslavement, yet it also celebrates the liberation from these chains and the physical freedom many of us have come to take for granted. Furthermore, it reminds us to always keep moving towards a brighter future no matter what we may have left behind.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell",NA,"Still Image",NA,"Haiti"

The Pratt deck truss bridge was built in 1899-1901, designed by the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad and constructed by the American Bridge Co. (Ambridge, PA). It is located in the Boone-Ogden Cutoff and crosses the Des Moines River at a point where the bluffs on either side are about 3000 feet apart. The bridge was nicknamed for the Iowa railroad heroine, Kate Shelley, also spelled Shelly. In 1881, when she was 17 years old, Kate Shelley risked her life to warn a passenger train by crossing the Des Moines River Bridge near Moingona at night, during a thunderstorm. Her goal was to warn the passenger train that the next bridge was out. That train had already been stopped. She then led rescuers to two men still in the swollen, flooded Honey Creek near her house, and they were saved. Her bravery was heralded in many newspapersListed in the National Register of Historic Places.","Kate Shelley High Bridge, Kate Shelley Memorial High Bridge, Boone High Bridge, Chicago & Northwestern Railroad viaduct, Boone Viaduct",NA,1905,"Iowa Historical Postcard Collection (IHPC), Grinnell College.

The block is centered around an image of a head both human and alien, evoking emotions such as pain, fear, and sadness. These are the emotions associated with colonialism and violence, of oppression and disease, and were likely felt by Haitians at the time of the revolution. While this musical being appears cry and mourn, it also inspires a sense of power and awe in the viewer, similar to the feeling of power that many Haitians were beginning to sense as the revolution took hold of Haiti.

These examples greatly extend the list given by Ekedahl and Serre of genera containing such curves, and provide more evidence for a positive answer to two questions they asked. Additionally, we produce new examples of families of curves, all of which have completely decomposable Jacobian varieties.

The author briefly reviews six related advances that profoundly extend and deepen economic analysis: game-theoretic modeling, collective-action problems, information economics and contracting, social preference theory, conceptualizing rationality, and institutional theory. He offers suggestions for incorporating these into the undergraduate classes at various levels. He argues that game-theoretic representation of collective action problems offers a unifying framework, on par with supply and demand, for political economy. Blending in the other developments deepens our micro-level understanding of internal and external contract enforcement, with implications on nonclearing markets, power, and distribution. At the macro level, these concepts illuminate the role of institutions in economic development and long-term growth.

He also sets a new challenge for sociology: explaining the time dynamics of social interaction. However, despite heavy reliance on the quantitative concept of positive feedback loops in his theory, Collins presents no mathematical specification of the dynamic relationships among his variables. This article seeks to fill that gap by offering a computational model that can parsimoniously account for many features of Collins’s theory. My model uses perceptual control theory to create an agent-based computational model of the time dynamics of conflict. With greater conceptual clarity and more wide-ranging generalizability, my alternative model opens the door to further advances in theory development by revealing dynamic aspects of conflict escalation not found in Collins’s model.","Computational Modeling Alternative to Collinss Theory of Conflict Escalation","American Sociological Association",2014,"Faculty Scholarship",NA,"text","Computer simulation, Multiagent systems, Perceptual control theory, Time, Systems and standards",NA

We will consider the impact of Darwin's thought in four areas: 1) the relationship between science and religion, 2) the question of design in nature, 3) current scientific understanding of the origin of life on earth (and related questions regarding extra-terrestrial life), and 4) application of Darwin's ideas to questions regarding human nature.","Tutorial, Fall 2000","Grinnell College",2000,"Digital Grinnell, Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository, Grinnell College.

Parker, the school district's first superintendent and author of the two-volume History of Poweshiek County, Iowa. An Oberlin graduate, he taught, by himself, all classes from primary through high school during the first year. Parker School replaced the Northwest School , which had been built at the same location in 1882 and was destroyed by fire. As the years progressed the facility became outdated and failed to meet recommended standards. Parker's site area was only 1.2 acres and with an enrollment of 149 students in 1961-62 fell far short of the optimum site area of 6.5 acres. When constructed, it was on the outskirts of town, but the growth of residential areas caused its location to become outmoded and the fact that it was situated on U.S. Highway 6 created safety questions. In 1970 the School Board decided to demolish the building at the end of the school year.

Phenotypic selection across a subspecies","grinnell:13252","Sister taxa often differ phenotypically, yet we generally do not know whether trait divergence reflects adaptation to spatially-varying selection. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, we ask whether selection favors the native phenotype in two parapatric subspecies of Clarkia xantiana (Onagraceae), an annual plant endemic to California. We quantified phenotypic selection in each of the exclusive ranges and the contact zone in two years with contrasting climates. We predicted that in the arid, pollinator-scarce eastern region of the distribution, phenotypes of the native subspecies (parviflora) have an advantage: small leaves, slow leaf growth, accelerated flowering, and diminutive flowers. In the wetter, pollinator-rich, western range of subspecies xantiana, we expected selection for the opposite phenotypes. We predicted that temporal variation in selection would favor xantiana¬-like traits during the first wet El Niño year and parviflora-like traits in the second dry La Niña year. For subspecies xantiana, selection generally favored native phenotypes in the native garden. However, for parviflora, selection sometimes favored non-native trait values. We found little evidence for pollinator-mediated selection, subspecies differences in pollen limitation to reproduction, or temporal variation in selection. Phenotypic differentiation appears to reflect divergent selection in xantiana, but not parviflora.",NA,"Grinnell College",2015,"Digital Grinnell, Faculty Scholarship",NA,"text","Biology., Evolution., Ecology., Natural selection., Plants.",NA

Using a two-step estimation procedure which incorporates three-digit industry wage regression coefficients into an aggregate wage growth identity equation, it finds that employment decline within unionized industries explains 18% of the post-1981 increase in the gap and that declining union ability to raise wages may explain as much as another 25%. Imports, on the other hand, do not appear to explain the gap independently of employment effects.",NA,"Sage Publications",1996,"Digital Grinnell, Faculty Scholarship",NA,"text","Employee motivation, Wages, Collective bargaining",NA

In the primary sector, fair wage comparisons, firm-specific human capital, and less perfect monitoring engender bilateral bargaining power, yielding high compensation, sometimes including a bonus. Secondary-sector employers exert unilateral bargaining power, via credible dismissal threats with no replacement costs, and offer no bonuses. Differential determinates of implicit bargaining power can potentially explain various phenomena, including nominal wage rigidity, union wage differentials, job-specific wage differentials, and gender or race-based wage differentials.",NA,"Mohr Siebeck GmbH & Co.

"2693","Foundations","grinnell:25493","When confronting the reality of plantation slavery in America, aspects of life which seemed normal in the early 1880’s are often difficult to conceptualize today. In this block, the artist calls attention to the tradition of child raising, in which slaves were given the task of nursing and raising their master’s progeny. It seems counter-intuitive that one could believe a slave so unworthy of human dignity, yet at the same time entrust them with the life of their child. In this block, a portrait of a slave with their master’s baby is framed by a pattern comprised of enlarged images of a human cell, encouraging a contemplation of the hypocrisies present in the theoretical foundations of slavery, including the supposed biological and intellectual inferiority of black people. Most often, slaves bore responsibilities foundational to the prosperity and functioning of their owners; they were worthy of motherhood but not the recognition of full humanity. By featuring a female-bodied slave in this block, the artist also pushes the viewer to contemplate the highly gendered nature of slave work and how it reveals inconsistencies in the theoretical foundations of racial superiority in America.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Slave-Owners, Children, Plantation life, Plantation Slavery, Wet nurse","Still Image",NA,"United States"

Scattered around the names of enlisted men, the artist has included pieces of metallic jewellery, linking the First Regiment of Iowa Volunteers to the Haitian Revolution. In this piece, the institution of slavery is represented by fragments of broken earrings, bracelets, and necklaces. The artist aimed to capture the harsh brutality of the struggle against slavery and racism, experienced by both Haitian revolutionaries in 1791 and also by members of the First Regiment of Iowa Volunteers in 1863. At the same time, some objects (such as the metallic pencil sharpener) are intended to portray the idea that the world is changeable and can be made better, a homage to the sacrifices made by the enlisted men of the First Regiment. This block parallels the struggle experienced in Haiti with the struggle experienced in the United States, and aims to show the relevancy and tangibility of these events even in today’s world. While the struggles of Haiti and the United States are very different, similarities between the two stories show the interconnectedness of history.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","First Regiment of Iowa Volunteers, African American Fire Fighters, Haitian Revolution, Abolition, Freedom Fighting","Still Image",NA,"Iowa, USA"

Introduction of sugarcane to the island is represented by the Gran Bwa veve, a religious symbol representing the loa Gran Bwa, a Vodou loa responsible for the health of herbs, trees, and other inhabitants of the land. In this block, the artists have chosen to include the Gran Bwa veve to represent an opposing force to the influx of sugarcane. After introducing the two opposing forces, the artists added images of malignant bacteria on the bottom left to symbolize the destruction that sugarcane caused on the island.

"3279","Grinnell Identities","grinnell:50","This study was interesting to examine how identity is tied to place. Positioned in the minds of those that give it meaning, “sense of place issues in a stream of symbolically drawn particulars-the visible particulars of local topographies, the personal particulars of biographical associations, and the notional particulars of socially given systems of thought” (Basso 1996:144). In other words, movement within a landscape will assign meaning to different places in that area. Meaning arises from interactions with the landscape-whether it be oral traditions tied to places within a place or events that happen in a place within recent time. As identity develops around place, “without hegemony, means and meaning may never come together, landscape representation may never become a reality, and social conflict will be open as space remains contested” (Harner 2001:676) and power can be exerted through the naming of “geographical entities, most particularly over the way in which places, their inhabitants and their social functions get represented” (Harvey 1990:419).So, we began to shape our study with this in mind.",NA,"Grinnell College",2011,"Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository, Digital Grinnell",NA,"Poster","Human geography, College Campuses, Grinnell College, Human factors","Grinnell (Iowa)"

Two of of Toussaint L'Ouverture’s sons, named Isaac and Saint-Jean, are featured prominently in this piece. Growing up with a famous and powerful father, these children enjoyed many more luxuries than most Haitian children, for the two boys were fortunate enough to be sent to France in 1797 to receive education in foreign languages and the arts. However, even relocation to Europe did not save the boys from meeting the same ill fate which met the other nine of L’Ouverture’s children, many of whom died before their father. Above the portraits of the L’Ouverture sons, the artists have included a depiction of children harvesting sugar cane in a pre-revolution Haiti. These children were exploited under the relentless control of plantation owners, seen here in suit jackets and straw hats, who robbed children of their childhood, education, families, and often their lives.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Haitian Revolution, Haiti, Haitian Rebellion, Toussant L'Ouverture, Children, Plantation Work, Sugar Cane, Isaac L'Ouverture, Saint-Jean L'Ouverture","Still Image",NA,"Haiti"

"3924","In Honor of Mary Touvestre","grinnell:25508","This block honors Mary Touvestre, a freed slave who risked her life to protect the Union army from a disastrous naval attack. This block includes an image of the plans for the Confederate ship The Merrimack, plans that were once stolen by Mary Touvestre, a housekeeper for a Confederate engineer in Norfolk. After hearing the engineer speak about the importance of the ship, Touvestre recognized the danger it imposed upon the Union’s naval forces who were blockading Norfolk’s supplies from Europe, imploring her to steal the plans for the ship and embark on a 195 mile trip through enemy lines to inform the Department of the Navy in Washington of the impending danger. In this block, the danger posed by the ship is highlighted by nails embedded around the head of the warship. The tangling string that weaves through the block depicts the length of the journey, and the risk shouldered by a black woman traveling on foot through Confederate lands. Touvestre report urged officials to speed up plans for constructing an ironclad ship for the Union army, saving them from an ugly attack for which they would not have been prepared. If Touvestre had never provided the intelligence, the USS Merrimac would have been given several more unchallenged weeks to quite possibly disrupt the Union’s blockade of Norfolk. The purpose of this block is to celebrate and honor the countless slaves and freed blacks living within Confederate regions who risked their lives to serve the Union army. In this piece, we also recognize the wider sacrifices made by black people to support a country that has continued to deny them humanity and safety.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","American Civil War, USS Merrimac, Mary Touvestre, Black Women Civil War Soldiers","Still Image",NA,"Haiti"
"3925","In Memory of Hannibal Kershaw","grinnell:25515","In this block the artists decided to honor Hannibal Kershaw and recognize the legacy he left on Grinnell during his time here as a student. Hannibal Kershaw was the first black student to graduate from Grinnell College in the early 19th century. The Iowa College Newsletter called Kershaw “an earnest, conscientious student, a fluent society speaker, and a man whom all respected for his high moral and religious character.” After graduating from Grinnell, he became a member of the South Carolina legislature and was also a teacher and a minister. Although Kershaw passed away only 4 years after leaving Grinnell, his memory is honored in the East Campus hall named for him, and now also in this piece of art. In this block, the artists have included a photograph of Kershaw along with the commemorative sign on Kershaw Hall, as well as keys and screws to symbolize not only the dorm, but also Kershaw’s commitment to building respectful race relations at the college and the symbolic doors he opened as the first black graduate of Grinnell. The artists also included a bird in flight, meant to remind viewers that while loved ones may be gone, their legacy will be remembered forever. Lastly, a piece of twine placed between these images reminds us of how connected the struggles of people of color are all over the world. Although Kershaw never set foot in Haiti, he certainly knew the pain and legacy of slavery and colonization, and felt the burn of racism even in Grinnell.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Iowa, Grinnell, Hannibal Kershaw, Iowa College Newsletter, Midwest","Still Image",NA,"Grinnell, IA"

"4001","Invitation","grinnell:25500","This block emerged from an invitation to participate in a campus-wide reflection on race, revolution, and artist’s place in our troubled social context. The ominous and powerful insect, the central image in this piece, is based on Alejo Carpentier's magical realist novel on the Haitian revolution, The Kingdom of this World. Is the insect colonialism? The revolution? It confronts the viewer with questions: Why don’t we know our own history, and why are we so afraid to teach it? In the same way that the insect confronts the viewer in this piece, we must confront our history and the ways in which it impacts our lives today. Although the insect hovers over us, threatening to destroy our memories, histories, and futures, we continue to coexist with it, allowing it to grow and respond to our changing conditions. The layering, movement, and sedimentation of the composition is meant to evoke the oceans, currents, and the troubling depths of race as “natural” yet at the same time constructed, still powerful and unsettling. It is a sea constantly troubled, whether we are aware or not. This block, and this installation as a whole, acts as an invitation to calmly evaluate ourselves in relation to our histories and education, without drowning in the waves.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Hatian Revolution, Haiti, Slave Rebellion, Haitian Revolution, Alejo Carpentier","Still Image",NA,"Haiti"

The effects of salt concentration, solvent composition, and temperature on the conductivity of the electrolytes are reported. In addition, conductivity data were fit using the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) equation to obtain the parameters s0, T0, and Ea, which correspond closely to conductivity and viscosity. All the electrolytes produced conductivities above the 1.0 mS cm1 threshold required for commercial application. The 1:1 (vl) solvent composition possesses the highest conductivity, with the optimal 0.8 M salt-loading yielding the highest s25 at 1.99 ± 0.02 mS cm1.",NA,"Elsevier",2014,"Faculty Scholarship, Student Scholarship","Electrolyte solvent blend, Lithium bis(oxalato)borate, Organosilicon electrolyte","text","Lithium ion batteries, Electrolyte solutions",NA

"4308","John Brown’s Body","grinnell:25505","John Brown is well-known for his abolitionist exploits throughout the antebellum United States. From leading armed groups in the Bleeding Kansas crisis to his near-successful raid on Harpers Ferry in Virginia, Brown made clear his staunch beliefs that slavery must be abolished and that violent insurrection was the only way to accomplish that goal. Eventually, these beliefs resulted in his downfall, as he was captured at Harpers Ferry by a United States Army regiment and later executed. What’s less commonly known about John Brown is his connection to Grinnell. While helping escaped slaves move along the Underground Railroad Brown slept at the home of J.B. Grinnell, founder of the town and supporter of the College. A photograph of this house is depicted in the lower right corner of this block, with an arrow pointing to the room where Brown stayed during his visit. Also included are two newspaper clippings from the Des Moines Register documenting Brown’s time in Iowa, including the story of a tense standoff in Iowa City shortly after he left Grinnell. At the center of the block is a portrait of J.B. Grinnell himself, found in the Grinnell College Archives. The words “John Brown’s Body” near the right edge of the block are a reference to the eponymous marching song sung by the Union Army to commemorate Brown’s sacrifice, the melody of which would go on to be reused in the now well-known Battle Hymn of the Republic. Like those who rebelled in Haiti, Brown believed that grassroots revolution could be an effective weapon against the institution of slavery and worked to advance equality for people of African descent.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","John Brown, Abolition, Abolitionist History, America, Anti-Slavery, Slavery, Bleeding Kansas, Harpers Ferry","Still Image",NA,"Grinnell, IA"

"4418","La Sirene","grinnell:25512","The centerpiece of this block is a formerly minted Haitian coin. The coin features a profile view of La Sirene, a mami wata (mermaid) and a Loa of wealth. The complex mythology of Haitian Vodou was centered around an extensive pantheon of deities called Loa, each representing a unique natural force or human attribute. La Sirene is married to Agwe, Loa of the sea, and is known to embody materialism and vanity. The objects which surround La Sirene were chosen for their association with the sea; the translucent blue and white pebbles remind us of crashing ocean waves, and the small floating moon above the coin alludes to the power La Sirene holds over the oceans and tides. The torn fishnet placed over the coin is a reference to a life spent in the seas, yet it also represents bondage, pillage, and liberation, reminding us of the terrible violence and awesome courage that led to the birth of the nation of Haiti. The artists also included La Sirene veve, a geometric religious symbol drawn on the floor of a sacred space with corn meal, wheat flour, soil, or chalk. These objects and drawings, collected and arranged by the artists, unite together to create a piece which honors the deity and her worship while also recognizing the struggle that enabled the minting of a uniquely Haitian currency, presented here almost like a trophy raised high at the end of a hard-fought battle.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Haiti, Haitian Revolution, Loa, La Sirene, Agwe, Vodou, Coins, Veve, Currency","Still Image",NA,"Haiti"

It is large but far from comprehensive, as publications with relevance to stone tool studies are literally innumerable. No mortal human could possibly read them all or would want to. Many entries are annotated, mostly notes to remember what was important in my research at the time and what I thought of an article. Comments [in brackets] thus reflect my interests and biases at some point in the last 30+ years, and I have occasionally added comments for students and others who might use this bibliography. The more recent notes tend to be longer as my memory gets shorter. Although irregular, the annotations and titles make it possible to search somewhat by key words and authors. Many of the unannotated newsletter articles are cited in my books. Articles primarily about atlatls or bows are in my Atlatl Bibliography and mostly not duplicated here. As they relate to my research projects, a few non-lithic miscellaneous experimental archaeology articles are included, some on looting, faking, archaeological politics and the antiquities market, and some archaeology related fiction.",NA,"Grinnell College",2015,"Digital Grinnell, Faculty Scholarship","Lithic implements","text","Anthropology, Stone implements",NA

Virginia","grinnell:25516","In 1967, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously voted to dismantle all state laws prohibiting intermarriage, overriding legal restrictions based on race written in 1883. In this block, created by studio assistant Leina’ala Voss, the first page of the Loving v. Virginia court transcript serves as a partial background on which two rings and a set of keys have been arranged; these objects symbolize the bond of marriage and evoke the feeling of a shared home. To the left of the court transcript the artist has placed a net, surrounded by metal nails, buttons, and fragments of colored flowers. Beneath the netting the words “race mixing is communism” appear as a headline above an image of a white protester, his face concealed behind dark sunglasses. This image is juxtaposed against a photograph which shows laughing children and their parents, innocent and unbothered by the chaos which surrounds them. By placing symbolic objects representative of marriage and domesticity alongside a supreme court document and Loving v. Virginia protest imagery, this block depicts how love itself has become a highly politicized issue defenseless against the noxious gass of racism and hatred. This block also reminds the viewer that even today we must not take our rings and keys, and the people we love, for granted; for there once was a time when even the love we feel for our family was unlawful in the eyes of our constitution.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Supreme Court of the United States, Loving v.

"5492","New Queer Cinema Today: Film and the critique of neoliberalism","grinnell:3419","In 1992, B. Ruby Rich coined the term New Queer Cinema to describe a cycle of films in the late 1980s and early 1990s that broke with conventional cinematic practices to show rethought subjectivities, generic subversions, and revised histories. New Queer Cinema, however, saw little of the same bursts of innovative directors and their films after 1992. This lag in revolutionary filmmaking left many evaluating queer cinema’s current state, even mourning the supposed end of New Queer Cinema. In this paper, I argue that queer filmmaking is not void of revolutionary potential; it is more that the driving force behind these films has changed. Instead of acting in opposition to a conservative government that failed to respond to the AIDS crisis, current queer work resists the normalizing effects of today’s neoliberal government. A cycle study of recent queer films reveals this driving revolutionary force.","Film and the critique of neoliberalism","Grinnell College",2012,"Digital Grinnell -- grinnell-collection:1, Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository, Student Scholarship","Assimilation, New Queer Cinema, AIDS crisis, Queer theory, Antisociality","text","Queer theory, Film criticism, Neoliberalism, AIDS (Disease)",NA

Then in 1917-1918 a poured concrete elevator and a block warehouse were built and still in use. 3 grocery stores that burned. The present building that still stands was a grocery store, but now is an apartment house. The railroad depot was demolished about 5 years ago. A water tank furnished water to the steam engines. A stock yard was available for the farmers cattle and hogs. We had our own post office. The creamery building still stands and did a route business and part of the building used as an ice house. We once had a prosperous bank, but it closed in 1933. There have been 2 blacksmith shops, a lumber yard. The farmers owned a telephone switchboard. One of the residents owned and operated a Model T agency. At one time we had 2 churches, the Church of God and the Congregational, this is now known as the UCC. A KP hall served as community center where the women gathered to sew during World War I. The lower floor housed new farm machinery.

After the war, the fort housed veteran soldiers for a time, and was turned over to the city in the early 1950s. Much of the original 640-acre base was sold off for development as the city grew. A number of the fort's buildings still stand, mainly on the southern and eastern edges of the parade ground. These buildings, including barracks, quarters, and stables, are now used for a variety of civic and commercial purposes. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 1911 postmark.

"5799","Origins of Research","grinnell:10743","Although economists in recent years have begun to apply economic theory to the activities of religious organizations, very few have ventured deeply into the realm of the Roman Catholic Church and almost none have considered the confluence between Internal Labor Market Theory and the promotional job ladder for ordained Catholic clergyman. This analysis explores the implications of the Catholic Church’s internal promotional ladder on its level of theological flexibility and hence its ability to adjust to changing market conditions. Specifically, by treating the Catholic Church as an organization subject to many of the same market forces as ordinary business firms, the research presented in this analysis shows how much of the “crisis” the church is confronting in the modern era—such as the rapid decline in the number of priests—can be explained by microeconomic structures that have developed over the past two millennia. At the broadest level, this analysis offers a new paradigm for viewing resistance to change in the church and provides a model for understanding the long-term implications of inflexibility on the viability of the church as an institution.","Internal Labor Market of the Roman Catholic Church.","Grinnell College",2010,"Frederick Baumann Essay Prize, Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository, Digital Grinnell","Frederick Baumann Essay Prize (2010)","Student paper","Supply and demand, Catholic Church, Labor market",NA

The house would serve as a clubhouse and the grounds were large enough to support tennis and a variety of field sports. A larger clubhouse was required and a Colonial Revival structure was built at the turn of the century. It included dining rooms, smoking and billiard rooms, a reading room and a ball room. A fire destroyed the building in April 1905, but it was rebuilt and opened in July of the same year. The club has continued to grow over the years and it has expanded its facilities and activities.

"6052","Portrait","grinnell:25490","This piece aims to honor the service of black and Haitian military men. When considering the Haitian Revolution we often tell the stories of men such as Toussaint L'Ouverture, one of too few symbols of black military power. This block places a black military leader at the center of attention, and also aims to connect his story with slavery in Haiti, America, and beyond. In this block, the image of the Haitian militia man appears beside an illustration of a cotton plant. Although slavery in Haiti was fueled by sugarcane, not cotton, an image of a cotton plant is placed here to remind the viewer that slavery is and shall remain a hallmark of American history, and issues of injustice in the military still occur today. When we consider the history of the transatlantic slave trade, we do not often think of its impact on how black people are treated in the military. Erased from history and celebration, black bodies were catalogued as equipment much like weapons and protective wear. While great progress has been made since the abolition of slavery and the integration of the military, we still have a long way to go in our quest for equal treatment of people of color as well as gay and transgender people in the military.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Slavery, Haiti, Hatian Revolution, Haitian Military History, Slave Trade, Cotton, Cane Sugar","Still Image",NA,"Haiti"

In 1917 the first officer candidate class of African Americans in US military history, trained at Fort Des Moines, and received commissions. Also in 1917 a training camp for black medical personnel began, and in 1918 the fort was used for the treatment of World War I casualties. In 1933-34 it was used as a Civilian Conservation Corps camp. With the entry of the United States into World War II, the fort was used as a training center for women, for service in the Army's Women's Army Corps. After the war, the fort housed veteran soldiers for a time, and was turned over to the city in the early 1950s. Much of the original 640-acre base was sold off for development as the city grew. A number of the fort's buildings still stand, mainly on the southern and eastern edges of the parade ground. These buildings, including barracks, quarters, and stables, are now used for a variety of civic and commercial purposes. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 1944 postmark.

"6725","Scholarly Communication and Liberal Arts College Libraries","grinnell:5075","Scholarly communication, in addition to referring to the disciplinary practices that structure the dissemination of scholarly knowledge, has become shorthand for two meanings: on the one hand, it refers to an analytic ""author/reader"" framework that seeks critical understanding of the entire life cycle of scholarly knowledge and the connected roles of researchers, teachers, students, funders, libraries, publishers, and other kinds of agencies in the creation, dissemination, critique, reuse, and preservation of knowledge. On the other hand, it embraces a public policy advocacy framework that critically examines the economic and legal relationships that constrain or facilitate the creation and flow of scholarly knowledge, urging recognition that knowledge is a kind of commons, with each discovery or innovation dependent on the accomplishments of earlier scholars. Despite the strong connections between the scholarly communications reform movement and research universities and research libraries, the economic, technological, and cultural changes under way in scholarly publishing affect many types of higher education institutions. Liberal arts colleges and their libraries also have a deep stake in the availability of scholarly literature and active engagement in efforts to illuminate and reform the scholarly publishing system, and have actively contributed to the movement. Many of the open access initiatives associated with the scholarly communication reform movement are directly relevant to the inquiry-based pedagogy characteristic of liberal arts college education.",NA,"American Library Association",2012,"Digital Grinnell, Faculty Scholarship -- grinnell-collection:35","Undergraduate education, Scholarly communication, Liberal arts colleges","text","Information literacy, Communication in learning and scholarship, Scholarly publishing, Universities and colleges -- United States, Academic libraries -- Collection development, Open access publishing, Collection development (Libraries)",NA

"6749","Schuetzen Park, Davenport, Iowa","grinnell:18457","In 1870, the Davenport Schuetzengesellschaft (later called the Schuetzen Verein) created this ""Schuetzenpark,"" or shooting park, as a target range for rifle marksmanship. In addition to the shooting and target houses, the park included an inn, dance hall, music pavilion, zoo, bowling alleys, roller coaster, refreshment stands, athletic field, picnic grounds, and other amusements. The popularity of Schuetzen Park began to decline around 1917, when the anti-German hysteria from World War I restricted the activities of German-Americans and led to the prohibition of the use of the German language in public. Many businesses and organizations changed their German names. For a time, Schuetzen Park was renamed Forest Park. The Davenport Schuetzen Verein became known by its English equivalent, the Davenport Shooting Association. The park was dealt another serious blow in 1919 when the ""Prohibition Act"" outlawed the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, which had been a major source of revenue for the park. The park was sold in 1923, and it became the site of the Chiropractic Psychopathic Sanitarium. However, today, much of the property again changed hands to the Davenport Good Samaritan Center and is being preserved as a ""Wildpark"". The only original park building that remains is the 1911 street car waiting station, which was named a local historic landmark in 1998 by the City of Davenport. It is located at 700 Waverly Road, Davenport, Scott County, Iowa. 1907 postmark. Number 2020.","Forest Park",NA,1907,"Iowa Historical Postcard Collection (IHPC), Grinnell College.

"6909","Social Context and the Spread of HIV: A game-theoretic investigation on impacts of social stigma and HIV education on epidemic outcomes","grinnell:11646","We provide a theoretical foundation for analyzing how social stigma and adopted behavioral traits affect the transmission of HIV across a population. We combine an evolutionary game-theoretic model—based on a relationship signaling stage game—with the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model of disease transmission. Our evolutionary model specifies how two types of social stigma—that which accompanies an HIV+ condition and that which follows associating with an HIV+ partner—influence behavioral propensities to honestly report one’s condition (or not) and to unconditionally accept relationships (or not). With respect to reporting an HIV+ condition, we find that condition stigma impedes the fitness of honest reporting, whereas association stigma impedes the relative fitness of concealing an HIV+ condition; and both propensities can coexist in a polymorphic equilibrium. By linking our model to the SIR model, we find that condition stigma unambiguously enhances disease transmission by discouraging both honest reporting and a society’s acceptance of AIDS education, whereas association stigma has an ambiguous impact: on one hand it can impede HIV transmission by discouraging concealing behavior and unconditional relationship acceptance, but it also compromises a society’s acceptance of AIDS education. Our relatively simple evolutionary/SIR model offers a foundation for numerous theoretical extensions—such as applications to social network theory—as well as foundation for many testable empirical hypotheses.","Game-theoretic investigation on impacts of social stigma and HIV education on epidemic outcomes","Grinnell College",2014,"Digital Grinnell, Faculty Scholarship",NA,"text","Stigma (Social Psychology), Game theory, AIDS (Disease)",NA

These activities include student-curated exhibits, events at which students read their own creative and scholarly works for a community audience, a peer mentoring program, ways to engage students in making decisions about how the library is run, and activities that create a feeling of community for diverse students and increase students’ awareness of diverse cultures. Research has shown that students who are more engaged are more likely to succeed in college, and the Grinnell College Libraries believe that their programs to increase student engagement are contributing to the success of Grinnell students.","Engagement at Grinnell College Libraries","Chandos Publishing, Grinnell College",2013,"Bauder, Julia, and Beth Bohstedt.

Secondly, despite the unquestioned musical quality of Porgy and Bess, companies, directors, and critics continue to debate whether to treat it as an opera, a musical, or a hybrid of the two. Furthermore, singing roles in staged productions of the opera, at least in the United States. are restricted to Black vocalists, challenging companies that would have to import enough Blacks to fill the opera‘s solo and choral parts.",NA,"IMSLP journal",2011,"http://imslpjournal.org/articles/Current-Perspectives-on-Porgy-and-Bess.pdf -- Digital Grinnell, IMSLP Journal, October 2011 -- Faculty Scholarship",NA,"text","Colorblind casting (Performing arts), Gershwin, George, 1898-1937, Porgy and Bess, Criticism, interpretation, etc., Musical theater, African Americans in musical theater","United States"

"7639","The Father of Grinnell","grinnell:25487","Grinnell’s history in relation to slavery often points to the man pictured in this block. J.B. Grinnell was a known advocate of abolition, and founded the very town of Grinnell on anti-slavery principles. He worked with the Underground Railroad to help slaves escape to Canada and served in Iowa’s Congress, even though his views on abolition made him quite unpopular amongst many Midwesterners. In the process of researching the life of J.B. Grinnell, the creator of this block was directed to a letter written by L.F. Parker describing an “incipient mob” driving five fugitive slaves out of the town of Grinnell. This letter encourages us to unpack the many layers of white abolitionist intention, and make distinctions between theory and action. While J.B. Grinnell had clearly intended for his town to be a space to live the tenets of the abolitionist movement, in practice this was not always the case. By showcasing this story, the artist urges viewers to contemplate the many phases and evolutions of freedom and abolition, knowing that good intention has yet to be enough.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Josiah Bushnell, Iowa, Grinnell, Underground Railroad, Slavery, Canada, Abolition, Anti-Slavery","Still Image",NA,"Grinnell, IA"

"7642","The Fire","grinnell:25506","On August 16th 1791, in the eleventh month of the Haitian Revolution, slaves from the Limbé district set fire to a wealthy French estate. During their subsequent interrogation they revealed the names of rebellion leaders, further advancing the story of the revolution. As the story of the rebellion spread over the island, slaves vowed to burn as many plantations as possible. Fiery acts such as these became more common as the revolution gathered steam, harming humans and animals alike and leaving the once beautiful Haitian landscape black and smoldering. In this block, the artist has used fake flower petals, red marbles, and enlarged images of orange microscopic organisms to create the sensation of heat and flames while also incorporating allusions to nature. The block revolves around an image depicting a burning plantation and a rioting mass of people running with arms raised, a scene from the 1791 revolt. On the left, a figure wearing a crown hangs from a tree, perhaps symbolizing the persecution of the Haitian people at the hands of French colonists.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Limb district, Haitian Revolution, Haiti, Slavery, Slave Rebellion, Fire","Still Image",NA,"Haiti"
"7643","The First Meeting","grinnell:25483","This piece aims to juxtapose Iowa’s progressive aims with its oppressive past.

While anti-slavery meetings such as this one were necessary in the push towards abolition, the artist urges Iowans to explore their state’s relationship to slavery on a deeper level. The artist has incorporated chain-like strands of metal to symbolize the bondage of enslaved peoples, and depictions of genetic material captures the implications of slavery for actual living organisms. While Grinnellians may sometimes put their town on a pedestal for its historic abolitionist position and refusal to join the Confederate Army, this block calls attention to the pain and suffering that still occurred in this state at the hands of racism and white supremacy.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Grinnell, Iowa, DNA, Slavery, Anti-slavery, Abolotion, John Brown","Still Image",NA,"United States"

To echo themes of agriculture, the artist included images of the cotton plant, as well as organic shapes which resemble flowers, seeds, and other found natural objects. Corn kernels, buttons, and leaves unite the realms of the home and the outdoors, as was often the case on a working plantation. The center photograph depicts slaves on a cotton plantation engaging in agricultural work, however the workers are not in motion but are posted in a triangular composition facing the photographer. The second photograph is also from a plantation, yet the subjects are household workers as opposed to field hands. These images both show life on the plantation, but only to an extent; they are purposefully arranged and therefore tell a very different story than a candid photograph might tell.

"7667","The Journey","grinnell:25495","This block was created around the theme of the journey. We all go through different journeys in our lives, some longer and more challenging than others, but every journey is important and demands courage and strength. This block honors those who were challenged by a specific journey unique to American history and relevant, even more specifically, to the state of Iowa; the story of the Underground Railroad. This block is comprised of a map of the Underground Railroad in the South, framed by a smattering of screws, pill capsules, buttons, stars, and other found objects. It also includes a photograph of the Lewelling House, a popular anti-slavery meeting house and renown safe stop on the Underground Railroad in an area of the Midwest particularly unfriendly to slaves and freed blacks during the years before the Civil War. Although the area of the South portrayed in the map is, of course, miles from the Lewelling House, the experience of black people in America is part of our entire country’s history, not just the areas most ravaged by institutional slavery and injustice. Although we often associate slavery with the American South, we must not forget that slavery was a national issue which demanded the attention of every city, small town, and individual, much like issues of racism still demand every person’s attention, no matter their race, today. The strewn nails and capsules surrounding the images in this block allude to journeys of different kinds, both physical and emotional. As our eyes follow the paths drawn by these loose objects we may be reminded of journeys we have taken in our own lives.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Slavery, America, Abolition, Underground Railroad, Anti-Slavery, Map","Still Image",NA,"United States"

Superimposed over an image of Iowa is a road map of the Underground Railroad, with squares and circles placed along the routes to indicate safety for runaway slaves. In the upper right hand corner of the state the artist has placed an image of the Lewelling house of Henry County, Iowa, a meeting place for abolitionist activists and one of the stops on the Underground Railroad. The stones and flowers which surround Iowa, vibrant and glimmering, allude to the power of preservation. With preservation in mind, we must ask ourselves: How can artists and activists revisit the historical bondage of our ancestors while attempting to move onwards to freedom? J.B. Grinnell founded Grinnell with abolition as one of his key tenets. As we peer into the history of Iowa we confront the question of whether Grinnell College continues to protect the freedom of the individual, or whether we have fallen into neoliberal agendas that serve our oppressors. The evocation of discomfort through the topic of slavery serves as a reminder of the necessity to reimagine the realities of imperialism within and without the U.S.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","J.

Drawing on participant observation of almost 300 worship and non-worship gatherings in seven Muslim, Protestant, and Catholic religious communities in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, as well as interviews with members of these communities, this paper investigates two key questions: 1) what opportunities exist for members of Indonesian worship communities to develop and practice the civic skills that are believed to facilitate political participation? and 2) does civic skill opportunity vary across religious denominations? The study introduces an original Civic Skill Opportunity scale, which, when tested, shows that mosques are less likely to develop the civic skills among their worshippers than are churches. These denominational differences can be explained by a house of worship’s embeddedness in a confessional hierarchy, style of worship, and the relative size of the religious denomination. This study’s findings could have important implications regarding how we think about religion in Southeast Asia, especially Islam, as an impediment or incubator of democracy.",NA,"Grinnell College",2016,"Digital Grinnell, Faculty Scholarship","Civic skills., Houses of worship.","text","Mosques., Mosques as community centers., Islam., Democracy.","Indonesia."

In this piece, the city is divided by a trail of nails; the buildings on the left side of the nails had received government funding for repair and the buildings on the right did not. The national poverty that necessitated this divide is one of the many ailments that plague formerly colonized nations; either you submit to imperial rule, or suffer economic consequences so often brushed aside as “third world problems.” In popular images of Port-au-Prince the right side of this picture is often cut out, eliminating the catastrophe from contemporary memory and thereby erasing the physical and emotional trauma caused by the disaster. The left side of this block depicts an ideal Haiti. A land warmed and nurtured by bright sunshine, this Haiti is known for its brightly colored houses and shell-speckled beaches, represented here with colorful sequins, marbles, and sea glass. The set of keys, paired with reflective shapes evocative of windows, call to mind a welcoming community where every family has a home. The right side of the block, however, represents the true Haiti. Economic class seems fixed enough to be nailed down. The black and amber stones represent Haiti’s crippling dependance on oil and external revenue, and the true Haiti is seen here still entangled in the net of poverty and colonialism. While this Haiti may seem grim, it is comprised of tools which can be used to build a brighter future. Buttons, screws, nails, and netting may look like detritus to some, but can transform into implements with which to achieve a more idyllic Haiti.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","Haiti, Haitian Revolution, Colonialism, Poverty, Port-au-Prince, Hurricane, Natural Disasters, Photography, Haitian Oil Dependance","Still Image",NA,"Haiti"

"7715","The Value of Information : Normativity, Epistemology, and LIS in Luciano Floridi","grinnell:6527","This paper is a critical reconstruction of Luciano Floridi’s view of librarianship as “stewardship of a semantic environment,” a view that is at odds with the dominant tradition in which library and information science (LIS) is understood as social epistemology. Floridi’s work helps to explain the normative dimensions of librarianship in ways that epistemology does not, and his Philosophy of Information frames librarians’ traditional stewardship role in terms appropriate for our growing involvement in the management and preservation of information through its entire life cycle. Floridi’s work also helps illuminate what is coming to be called “knowledge as a commons.” Librarianship is concerned with maintaining and enhancing information environments over time, environments that include the behavior of the people who create and use them. The integrity of these environments makes possible the epistemic projects of faculty, students, and other researchers, but librarianship is not, itself, epistemological. Floridi’s ecological reframing of philosophy of information and information ethics, bridging the dichotomy between information and user, has a variety of implications for information literacy education and other academic library services in higher education.

However, these men were not the only people involved in the dramatic uprising. Haitian women, too, played a large role in the rebellion, and this block honors the female freedom fighters who often go unnoticed in modern tellings of the story. In the lower center of the block the artist has placed a Haitian ten gourd banknote, featuring sergeant and lieutenant Sanité Bélair who fought bravely under the command of Toussaint LOuverture. To her left is a depiction of Marie-Jeanne Lamartiniére, a Haitian soldier who fought in male uniform and is said to have greatly boosted the spirits of her male counterparts with her invigorating bravery. On the right hand side of the block we see an image of Cécile Fatiman, a mambo (Vodou priestess) said to have participated in the Vodou ritual at Bwa Kayiman, a ceremony during which the first slave insurrection was planned.

The Iowa Bystander targeted a black audience and employed black writers, unlike most Iowa newspapers at the time who would not hire black journalists. The Bystander outspokenly criticized American society, taking on several different issues such as the Ku Klux Klan, racist advertising practices, and unequal treatment of blacks in the American armed forces. Most black newspapers in the United States at this time had an average lifespan of about nine years, but the Bystander lasted more than eighty years due to its strong leadership under publishers like John Lay Thompson and J.B. Morris, making it one of the most successful black newspapers in the country. This block incorporates different clippings from the Iowa Bystander. The clippings include several ads for employment opportunities, an advertisement for a colored cafe, and an article about the Iowa State Federation Colored Women’s Club. The paper paid tribute to various women in the ranks of the club, and included beautiful portraits of many of the women involved. Through their journalism, the Bystander was able to empower and connect blacks across America. Newspapers like the Bystander played a critical role in uniting black communities and creating a space for them in white America.",NA,"Grinnell College",2017,"Digital Grinnell","John Lay Thompson, J.B.
